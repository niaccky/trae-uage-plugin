# Project Overview

**Trae Usage Plugin** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help users monitor their Trae AI usage and quota.

## Key Features
- **Visual Dashboard**: Displays current usage and remaining quota with progress bars.
- **Model Breakdown**: Detailed statistics for individual AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
- **Auto-Save**: Securely stores the user's Trae cookie in local storage.
- **UI Adaptation**: Supports VS Code themes (light/dark mode).
- **Privacy**: Cookies are used only for direct API requests and are not sent to third-party servers.

## Usage
Users need to provide their Trae account cookie to fetch usage data. The extension adds a status bar item and a command `Trae Usage Plugin: Show Usage` to open the dashboard.
